# ProcJam2015 - ProcJammer
This is my procedural music generation (or jammer) library, made for ProcJam 2015. It generates a song and strums along to it on a guitar. <a href="http://colthor.itch.io/procjammer">There is a demo on itch.io here</a>.

Feel free to use it, and the guitar samples, for any purpose you like. A credit would be nice if it winds up in something publically available :)

And if that something is the next Minecraft and you wind up with a couple of billion currency units you don't know what to do with, I will not mind at all if you give a few to me.

To continue with hopeful speculation, there are loads more things I'd like to do with this, and hope to continue development in the future.

Sorry for blatantly stealing/abusing your jam's name, Mike.
